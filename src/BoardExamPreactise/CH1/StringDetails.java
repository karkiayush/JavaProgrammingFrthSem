/*
 * String as Immutable Java Objects:
 * 
 * In Java, strings are treated as immutable objects, meaning their values
 * cannot be changed once they are created. Here are some key points about
 * strings being immutable:
 * 
 * String Creation: When you create a string in Java, it becomes a new object in
 * memory. Strings can be created using string literals or the new keyword.
 * 
 * String Pool: Java maintains a special pool called the "string pool" or
 * "string constant pool" to store unique string literals. This allows string
 * literals with the same value to share the same memory location, conserving
 * memory.
 * 
 * Immutable Behavior: Once a string object is created, its value cannot be
 * changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new
 * string object with the modified value.
 * 
 * String Concatenation: When you concatenate strings using the + operator, Java
 * creates a new string containing the concatenated value. This behavior ensures
 * that the original strings remain unchanged.
 * 
 * Thread Safety: Since strings are immutable, they are inherently thread-safe.
 * Multiple threads can read and share the same string object without worrying
 * about concurrent modifications.
 * 
 * Caching and Optimization: Immutability allows Java to perform various
 * optimizations, such as caching hash codes, which improves performance in
 * operations like string comparisons and hash-based data structures.
 * 
 * Security and String Literals: Immutability also enhances security by
 * preventing attackers from modifying sensitive string data.
 * 
 * Memory Efficiency: While creating many string objects may seem
 * memory-intensive, the string pool reduces the overhead by reusing existing
 * string instances.
 * 
 * Example of String Immutability:
 * 
 * java
 * Copy code
 * String str1 = "Hello";
 * String str2 = str1; // Both str1 and str2 point to the same "Hello" in the
 * pool
 * str1 = str1 + " World"; // A new string "Hello World" is created
 * 
 * System.out.println(str1); // Output: Hello World
 * System.out.println(str2); // Output: Hello
 * In this example, str1 is concatenated with " World," creating a new string
 * object in memory. str2 still references the original "Hello" in the string
 * pool.
 * 
 * In summary, strings being immutable in Java has several benefits, including
 * simplified concurrency handling, enhanced security, and optimization
 * opportunities. However, developers need to be aware that string concatenation
 * operations can create new objects, which might affect memory usage in certain
 * scenarios.
